\section{Conclusions}
We have presented XSnare, a fully client-side protection mechanism against XSS. This approach has many benefits over currently existing systems, as well as being complementary to many of them. Our firewall architecture makes it so that users can protect themselves in the face of an ever-increasing number of potential attacks and attack vectors, with little additional effort required for a knowledgeable security analyst when taking into consideration the existing vulnerability detection work flow. The CVE study we conducted showed that the provided API for sanitization and injection point detection is effective, as 93.4\% of these vulnerabilities could be defended against with our tool. Our prototype implementation meets the required performance goals to not be detrimental to an user's web browsing experience, as web page load times are affected by less than 10\% overhead on 72.6\% of sites.
