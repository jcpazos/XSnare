\section{Conclusions}
We have presented a fully client-side solution to the XSS problem. This approach has many benefits over currently existing systems, as well as being complementary to many of them. Our firewall architecture makes it so that users can protect themselves in the face of an ever-increasing number of potential attacks and attack vectors, with very little additional user effort required. The study we conducted shows that a majority of websites can benefit from our defence strategy and, thus, we conclude that this is a viable system. Our implementation is still a work in progress and will continue to become more robust both in terms of being able to defend against a myriad of attacks, as well as providing ease of development for database signatures.
