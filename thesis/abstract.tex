We present XSnare, a fully client-side XSS solution, implemented as a Firefox extension. Our approach takes advantage of available previous knowledge of a webpage's HTML, as well as the rich context available in the DOM to interpose on these attacks. It uses a database of exploit descriptions to prevent them, effectively singling out injection points in the HTML, and preventing malicious code from executing in these. This tool allows users to protect themselves without having to wait for developers to patch their code once a vulnerability has been released. 
\\We evaluate the applicability of our approach by studying the latest 100 CVEs related to XSS attacks in WordPress, and find that our tool defends against 93.4\% of these exploits. Our peformance evaluation shows that our extension's overhead on web page loading time is less than 10\% for 75\% of sites.
