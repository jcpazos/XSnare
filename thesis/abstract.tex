We present XSnare, a fully client-side cross-site scripting (XSS) solution, implemented as a Firefox extension. Our approach takes advantage of available previous knowledge of a web application's HTML template content, as well as the rich context available in the DOM to interpose on these attacks. It uses a database of exploit descriptions, which are written with the help of previously recorded CVEs, to prevent them. CVEs for XSS are widely available and are one of the main ways to tackle zero-day exploits. We effectively single out injection points in the HTML, preventing malicious code from executing in these vulnerable points. XSnare allows users to protect themselves without having to wait for developers to patch their code once a vulnerability has been released, by providing a framework in which a developer's intended server-side patch can be emulated on the client-side.
\\We evaluate the applicability of our approach by studying the latest 100 CVEs related to XSS attacks in WordPress, and find that our tool defends against 93.4\% of these exploits. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to systematically study an XSS protection tool on real-world exploits in the form of CVEs. Our peformance evaluation shows that our extension's overhead on web page loading time is less than 10\% for 72.6\% of sites.
