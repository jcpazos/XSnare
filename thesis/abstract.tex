We present \sys, a client-side \ac{XSS} solution implemented as
a Firefox extension. The client-side design of \sys can protect users
before application developers release patches and before server
operators apply them.

\sys blocks XSS attacks by using previous knowledge of a web
application's HTML template content and the rich DOM context. \sys
uses a database of exploit descriptions, which are written with the
help of previously recorded CVEs. It singles out injection points for
exploits in the HTML and dynamically sanitizes content to prevent
malicious payloads from appearing in the DOM. \sys displays a secured
version of the site, even if is exploited.

We evaluated \sys on 81 recent CVEs related to XSS attacks, and found
that it defends against 93.8\% of these exploits. To the best of our
knowledge, \sys is the first protection mechanism for XSS that is
application-specific, and based on publicly available CVE information.
We show that \sys{}'s specificity protects users against exploits
which evade other, more generic, XSS defenses.

Our performance evaluation shows that our extension's overhead on web
page loading time is less than 10\% for 72.6\% of the sites in the Moz
Top 500 list.
