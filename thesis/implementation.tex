\section{Implementation}

TODO: say what extension is implemented on and sanitization used + discussion on sanitization + more details on network filter and signatures that require other type of listener, e.g. script, XHR.
TODO: say how signatures are stored, client-side and server-side.
TODO: maybe a description of the thought process for a signature developer?
Anything else???
