don't trust the locals: prevalnce of persisnte client-side cross-site scripting
Study about persistent client-side XSS. Authors argue this type of XSS has not been
well-covered by academic work. They find that 8% of Alexa top 5k are vulnerable to this,
and 21% of websites that use storage API are vulnerable.

For part mentioning how most input should be sanitized: they find that 90 sites persisted
JavaScript on purpose, and thus can't be sanitized, it would break fucntionality, and 5
contained a mix which was hard to tell if it should be sanitized.
