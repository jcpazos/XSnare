-Can't do anything about problem mentioned last week, just use the last endpoint 
and sanitize everything in between. Might get rid of good stuff, but no way around it.
Signature developer can specify whether this or just blocking the page as a whole should occur.
about problem with endpoint detection:
For unique-several, the algorithm assumes the ending point to be the latest to be found. 
Additionally, if the exploit can occur with the same endpoints in several different spots in the HTML, you always
grab the latest one. In this case, this might get rid of large amounts of the HTML, and is up to the signature writer
to decide whether they just want to block the page from rendering.
