This is analogous\n                to a Backbone.Router method. It must uniquely represent the *visual state* of the application\n                at the time of the interaction we are logging. Applications may have only one route, or\n                they may have many routes.\n\n            Area\n                An xpath-ish type identifier that describes where in the DOM the logged interaction took place,\n                if any.

This is analogous\n                to a Backbone.Router method. It must uniquely represent the *visual state* of the application\n                at the time of the interaction we are logging.
